\noindent\textbf{Problem Statement:} Watch all the video lectures, and derive the governing equation for the kinetic energy, defined as k = 1/2(u2 + v2 + w2). The technique involves multiplying the x-momentum equation by the u velocity, y-momentum by the v velocity, and z-momentum equation by the w velocity, and eventually add all three equations up. Show your derivation process.
