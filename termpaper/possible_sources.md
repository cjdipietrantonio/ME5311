TOPIC: The Black–Scholes–Merton equation (financial derivative modeling) and connection to the transported probability density function method

Essential, high‑leverage sources that give you the mathematical, economic, and conceptual tools to make the fluids–finance connection airtight.
Here is the minimal, elite list.
⭐ 1. Shreve — Stochastic Calculus for Finance II: Continuous-Time Models
Why it’s essential
This is the mathematical backbone of your finance section. It gives you:
	• Ito calculus in the exact form you need
	• the SDE → PDE connection
	• forward/backward Kolmogorov equations
	• the rigorous derivation of the Black–Scholes PDE
	• the risk‑neutral measure explained cleanly
This is the finance‑side equivalent of Pope: mathematically precise, conceptually clean, and directly relevant to your PDF‑transport connection.
If you only used one finance book, it would be this one.
⭐ 2. Baxter & Rennie — Financial Calculus
Why it’s essential
This is the economic logic behind the math.
It gives you:
	• arbitrage arguments
	• martingale pricing
	• the meaning of risk‑neutral valuation
	• the economic interpretation of the BSM PDE
Shreve tells you how the math works. Baxter & Rennie tell you why the math makes financial sense.
Your paper needs both.
⭐ 3. Pope — Turbulent Flows
Why it’s essential
You already have this one, and it’s the perfect source for the fluids side.
It gives you:
	• the transported PDF equation
	• the forward Kolmogorov structure
	• stochastic differential equations in turbulence
	• Monte Carlo particle methods
	• the exact mathematical machinery that parallels BSM
This is the authoritative source for the turbulence/PDF side of your argument.
🎯 That’s it. Three books.
With these three, you can write a paper that is:
	• mathematically rigorous
	• economically correct
	• physically grounded
	• conceptually original
	• publishable‑quality
Everything else (Wilmott, Hull, etc.) is optional enrichment, not essential.
🧠 Why this minimal set works so well
Each book covers a different pillar of your argument:
Pillar	Book	Why it’s needed
Stochastic calculus + PDE duality	Shreve	Connects BSM ↔ Kolmogorov ↔ transported PDFs
Economic meaning of pricing	Baxter & Rennie	Arbitrage, martingales, risk‑neutral drift
Turbulence + PDF transport	Pope	The fluids side of the analogy
Together, they give you everything you need — and nothing you don’t.
